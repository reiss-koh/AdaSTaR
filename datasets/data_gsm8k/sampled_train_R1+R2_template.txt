The extra amount he will earn when he works on his overtime is $ [aa, 8] x [ac, 50] / [ag, 100] = $ << [aa, 8] * [ac, 50] / [ag, 100] = [ae, 4] >> [ae, 4] . So the amount he will earn on his overtime is $ [aa, 8] + $ [ae, 4] = $ << [aa, 8] + [ae, 4] = [ah, 12] >> [ah, 12] . Since he will render overtime once every week , the total overtime pay he will earn in a month is $ [ah, 12] x [ae, 4] = $ << [ah, 12] * [ae, 4] = [ai, 48] >> [ai, 48] . Therefore the total money he will earn in a week is $ [af, 160] + [ai, 48] = $ << [af, 160] + [ai, 48] = [answer, 208] >> [answer, 208] . #### [answer, 208]
Conditions:
[aa, 8] * [ab, 5]=[ad, 40]
[ad, 40] * [ae, 4]=[af, 160]
[aa, 8] * [ac, 50] / [ag, 100]=[ae, 4]
[aa, 8] + [ae, 4]=[ah, 12]
[ah, 12] * [ae, 4]=[ai, 48]

Next , figure out how much all [ad, 3] houses cost by dividing [ Nigella , name ]' s commission money by her commission rate : $ [ag, 5000] ÷ [ah, 0.02] = $ << [ag, 5000] / [ah, 0.02] = [ai, 250000] >> [ai, 250000] . Next , express each house ' s price in terms of A ' s price : B = [ad, 3] A , and C = [ab, 2] A - $ [af, 110000] . Now we know that A + [ad, 3] A + [ab, 2] A - $ [af, 110000] = $ [ai, 250000] . We can combine like terms to find that [aj, 6] A - $ [af, 110000] = $ [ai, 250000] . Now we add $ [af, 110000] to both sides of the equation and get [aj, 6] A = $ [ak, 360000] .

Symb question:
A blind cave scorpion survives by catching millipedes . It needs to eat lots of millipedes to survive : a total of [aa, 800] body segments every day . If it ' s already eaten [ab, 1] millipede with [ac, 60] segments and [ad, 2] millipedes that are [ad, 2] as long , how many [ae, 50] - segment millipedes does it need to eat to reach its daily total ?
Symb answer:
First , the number of segments in the [ad, 2] millipedes that are [ad, 2] as long is [ac, 60] segments * [ad, 2] = << [ac, 60] * [ad, 2] = [af, 120] >> [af, 120] segments . Then [ab, 1] can multiply the segments by the [ad, 2] millipedes to find the total number of segments : [af, 120] segments / millipede * [ad, 2] millipedes = << [af, 120] * [ad, 2] = [ag, 240] >> [ag, 240] segments . In total , we then find the scorpion has eaten [ab, 1] [ac, 60] - segment millipede in addition to the [ah, 3] millipedes above for a total of [ac, 60] + [ag, 240] = << [ac, 60] + [ag, 240] = [ai, 300] >> [ai, 300] segments . So , the number of segments it still needs to eat are : [aa, 800] segments - [ai, 300] segments = << [aa, 800] - [ai, 300] = [aj, 500] >> [aj, 500] segments Thus , it needs to eat an additional [aj, 500] segments / [ae, 50] segments / millipede = << [aj, 500] / [ae, 50] = [answer, 10] >> [answer, 10] millipedes . #### [answer, 10]
Conditions:
[ac, 60] * [ad, 2]=[af, 120]
[af, 120] * [ad, 2]=[ag, 240]
[ac, 60] + [ag, 240]=[ai, 300]
[aa, 800] - [ai, 300]=[aj, 500]
[aj, 500] / [ae, 50]=[answer, 10]

Symb answer:
There are a total of [aa, 52] + [ab, 38] = << [aa, 52] + [ab, 38] = [af, 90] >> [af, 90] parking spaces in the school . Since half of the spaces are filled then , [ab, 38] x [ad, 1] / [ae, 2] = << [ab, 38] * [ad, 1] / [ae, 2] = [ag, 19] >> [ag, 19] cars have parked at the back . So , a total of [ac, 39] + [ag, 19] = << [ac, 39] + [ag, 19] = [ah, 58] >> [ah, 58] cars have parked in the school . Therefore , [af, 90] - [ah, 58] = << [af, 90] - [ah, 58] = [answer, 32] >> [answer, 32] parking spaces are still available . #### [answer, 32]

Symb question:
A candy store sold [aa, 20] pounds of fudge for $ [ab, 2.50] / pound , [ac, 5] dozen chocolate truffles for $ [ad, 1.50] each and [ae, 3] dozen chocolate - covered pretzels at $ [af, 2.00] each . How much money did the candy store make ?
Symb answer:
[aa, 20] pounds of fudge at $ [ab, 2.50] / pounds is [aa, 20] * [ab, 2.50] = $ << [aa, 20] * [ab, 2.50] = [ag, 50.00] >> [ag, 50.00] The [ac, 5] dozen truffles were sold in individual units so a dozen is equal to [ah, 12] so [ac, 5] * [ah, 12] = << [ac, 5] * [ah, 12] = [ai, 60] >> [ai, 60] [ai, 60] chocolate truffles , at $ [ad, 1.50] each sold for [ai, 60] * [ad, 1.50] = $ << [ai, 60] * [ad, 1.50] = [aj, 90.00] >> [aj, 90.00] The [ae, 3] dozen chocolate pretzels sold in individual units so a dozen is equal to [ah, 12] so [ae, 3] * [ah, 12] = << [ae, 3] * [ah, 12] = [ak, 36] >> [ak, 36] [ak, 36] chocolate pretzels sold for $ [af, 2.00] each sold for [ak, 36] * [al, 2] = $ << [ak, 36] * [al, 2] = [am, 72.00] >> [am, 72.00] All total , the store made [an, 50] + [ao, 90] + [ap, 72] = $ << [an, 50] + [ao, 90] + [ap, 72] = [aq, 212.00] >> [aq, 212.00] from candy sales #### [answer, 212]
Conditions:
[aa, 20] * [ab, 2.50]=[ag, 50.00]
[ac, 5] * [ah, 12]=[ai, 60]
[ai, 60] * [ad, 1.50]=[aj, 90.00]
[ae, 3] * [ah, 12]=[ak, 36]
[ak, 36] * [al, 2]=[am, 72.00]
[an, 50] + [ao, 90] + [ap, 72]=[aq, 212.00]

Symb question:
The ratio representing the age of [ Halima , gpe ], [ Beckham , gpe ], and [ Michelle , name ] is [aa, 4] : [ab, 3] : [ac, 7] , respectively . If the total age for the [ab, 3] siblings is [ad, 126] , calculate the age difference between Halima and [ Beckham , gpe ].
Symb answer:
The total ratio representing the age of the [ab, 3] siblings is [aa, 4] + [ab, 3] + [ac, 7] = << [aa, 4] + [ab, 3] + [ac, 7] = [ae, 14] >> [ae, 14] [ Halima , name ]' s age is represented by the fraction [aa, 4] / [ae, 14] , which means she is [aa, 4] / [ae, 14] * [ad, 126] = [af, 36] years old . Beckhams age , from the total age of the [ab, 3] , is [ab, 3] / [ae, 14] * [ad, 126] = << [ab, 3] / [ae, 14] * [ad, 126] = [ag, 27] >> [ag, 27] The difference in age between Halima and [ Beckham , gpe ] is [af, 36] - [ag, 27] = << [af, 36] - [ag, 27] = [answer, 9] >> [answer, 9] #### [answer, 9]
Conditions:
[aa, 4] + [ab, 3] + [ac, 7]=[ae, 14]
[ab, 3] / [ae, 14] * [ad, 126]=[ag, 27]
[af, 36] - [ag, 27]=[answer, 9]

Symb question:
[ Dani , name ] has [aa, 3] cats ; [ Binkie , gpe ], [ Frankie , gpe ] and Spaatz . Each cat has a collar decorated with gemstones . Binkie has [ab, 4] times as many gemstones on his collar as does [ Frankie , name ] but [ Spaatz , name ] has [ac, 2] less than half as many gemstones on her collar as does [ Frankie , name ]. If [ Spaatz , name ] has [ad, 1] Gemstone on her collar , how many gemstones does Binkie have on his collar ?
Symb answer:
If [ Spaatz , name ] has [ac, 2] less than half the number of gemstones as does [ Frankie , name ], then half as many as [ Frankie , name ] is [ad, 1] + [ac, 2] = [aa, 3] gemstones If [aa, 3] is half the number of gemstones on [ Frankie , name ]' s collar , then [ Frankie , name ] has [aa, 3] * [ac, 2] = << [aa, 3] * [ac, 2] = [ae, 6] >> [ae, 6] gemstones . If Binkie has [ab, 4] times as many gemstones as [ Frankie , name ], then Binkie has [ab, 4] * [ae, 6] = << [ab, 4] * [ae, 6] = [answer, 24] >> [answer, 24] #### [answer, 24]
Conditions:
[aa, 3] * [ac, 2]=[ae, 6]
[ab, 4] * [ae, 6]=[answer, 24]
