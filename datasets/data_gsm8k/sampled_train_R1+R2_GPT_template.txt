Symb question:
[Isabelle,name] gets a job so she can save enough money to go to a concert with her [aa, 2] brothers. Her ticket costs $ [ab, 20]. Her brothers both get the children’s discount, and each of their tickets cost $ [answer, 10]. Her brothers have saved $ [ac, 5] between the [aa, 2] of them and [Isabelle,name] has saved $ [ac, 5]. If her job pays $ [ad, 3] per week, how many weeks must she work to afford the tickets?
Symb answer:
The tickets for both of her brothers will cost her $ [answer, 10] * [aa, 2] = $ << [answer, 10] * [aa, 2] = [ab, 20] >> [ab, 20]. To buy tickets for all of them, it will cost [Isabelle,name] $ [ab, 20] + $ [ab, 20] = $ << [ab, 20] + [ab, 20] = [ae, 40] >> [ae, 40]. Between all of them, they have saved a total of $ [ac, 5] + $ [ac, 5] = $ << [ac, 5] + [ac, 5] = [answer, 10] >> [answer, 10]. Since they have already saved $ [answer, 10], she needs to earn an additional $ [ae, 40] - $ [answer, 10] = $ << [af, 30] = [af, 30] >> [af, 30] to afford the tickets. Since she makes $ [ad, 3] per week, it will take her $ [af, 30] / ( $ [ad, 3] / week ) = << [af, 30] / ( [ad, 3] ) = [answer, 10] >> [answer, 10] weeks to save enough money for all of the tickets. #### [answer, 10]
Conditions:
[answer, 10] * [aa, 2]=[ab, 20]
[ab, 20] + [ab, 20]=[ae, 40]
[ac, 5] + [ac, 5]=[answer, 10]
[af, 30]=[af, 30]
[af, 30] / ( [ad, 3] )=[answer, 10]

Symb answer:
[Gab,name] scored [aa, 20] x [ab, 2] = << [aa, 20] * [ab, 2] = [ad, 40] >> [ad, 40] points. [Cher,name] scored [ad, 40] x [ab, 2] = << [ad, 40] * [ab, 2] = [ae, 80] >> [ae, 80] points. Their team scored [aa, 20] + [ad, 40] + [ae, 80] = << [aa, 20] + [ad, 40] + [ae, 80] = [af, 140] >> [af, 140] points. Therefore, they scored [af, 140] - [ac, 85] = << [af, 140] - [ac, 85] = [answer, 55] >> [answer, 55] more points than their opponent. #### [answer, 55]
Conditions:
[aa, 20] * [ab, 2]=[ad, 40]
[ad, 40] * [ab, 2]=[ae, 80]
[aa, 20] + [ad, 40] + [ae, 80]=[af, 140]

Symb answer:
With the boy’s contribution, there are [ab, 12] + [aa, 6] = << [ab, 12] + [aa, 6] = [af, 18] >> [af, 18] walnuts. When he drops [ac, 1], now they have [af, 18] - [ac, 1] = << [af, 18] - [ac, 1] = [ag, 17] >> [ag, 17] walnuts. The girl adds to their stash, making the count [ag, 17] + [ad, 5] = << [ag, 17] + [ad, 5] = [ah, 22] >> [ah, 22] walnuts. When the girl eats [ae, 2], the final count is [ah, 22] - [ae, 2] = << [ah, 22] - [ae, 2] = [answer, 20] >> [answer, 20] walnuts. #### [answer, 20]
Conditions:
[ab, 12] + [aa, 6]=[af, 18]
[af, 18] - [ac, 1]=[ag, 17]
[ag, 17] + [ad, 5]=[ah, 22]
[ah, 22] - [ae, 2]=[answer, 20]

[Claire,name] is scheduling her day. She has [aa, 4] hours to clean and [ab, 2] hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps [ac, 8] hours. If all of this takes place within [ad, 1] day, how many hours did [Claire,name] spend crafting?
Symb answer:
We know [Claire,name] has spent a total of [ae, 24] hours in a day - [aa, 4] hours cleaning - [ab, 2] hours cooking - [ac, 8] hours sleeping = [af, 10] hours crafting and tailoring. Since she split her time equally, she must have spent [af, 10] hours * [ag, 0.5] = << [af, 10] * [ag, 0.5] = [answer, 5] >> [answer, 5] hours crafting. #### [answer, 5]
Conditions:

Symb question:
[Xena,name] is trying to outrun a dragon to get to the safety of a cave it’s too big to fit into. [Xena,name] has a [aa, 600] foot head start, but the dragon can burn her if it gets within [ab, 120] feet of her. If [Xena,name] runs [ac, 15] feet per second and the dragon flies [ad, 30] feet per second, how many seconds does [Xena,name] have to get to the cave?
Symb answer:
First find the size of the gap the dragon needs to close to burn [Xena,name]: [aa, 600] ft - [ab, 120] ft = << [aa, 600] - [ab, 120] = [ae, 480] >> [ae, 480] ft. Then find how many feet closer the dragon gets each second by subtracting [Xena,name]'s speed from the dragon's speed: [ad, 30] ft/sec - [ac, 15] ft/sec = << [ad, 30] - [ac, 15] = [ac, 15] >> [ac, 15] ft/sec. Then divide the distance by the speed difference to find how many seconds it takes for the dragon to get close enough to burn [Xena,name]: [ae, 480] ft / [ac, 15] ft/sec = << [ae, 480] / [ac, 15] = [answer, 32] >> [answer, 32] sec. #### [answer, 32]
Conditions:
[aa, 600] - [ab, 120]=[ae, 480]
[ad, 30] - [ac, 15]=[ac, 15]
[ae, 480] / [ac, 15]=[answer, 32]

They have found that this kind of stimulus returns [ac, 5] times as much money to the government, in terms of tax revenue, as it cost. The city has [ad, 1000] people in it. What was the government profit from this project?
Symb answer:
They gave money to [ad, 1000] * . [ae, 2] = << [ad, 1000] * . [ae, 2] = [af, 200] >> [af, 200] people. It cost [af, 200] * [ab, 2000] = $<< [af, 200] * [ab, 2000] = [ag, 400000] >> [ag, 400000]. There was a [ac, 5] to [ah, 1] return so the government collected [ac, 5] * [ag, 400000] = $<< [ac, 5] * [ag, 400000] = [ai, 2000000] >> [ai, 2000000]. That means the profit was [ai, 2000000] - [ag, 400000] = $<< [ai, 2000000] - [ag, 400000] = [answer, 1600000] >> [answer, 1600000]. #### [answer, 1600000]
Conditions:
[ad, 1000] * . [ae, 2]=[af, 200]

It rained [aa, 2] as much on Tuesday as Monday. On Monday it rained [ab, 3] inches more than Sunday. It rained [ac, 4] inches on Sunday. How much total rainfall was there over the [ab, 3] days?
Symb answer:
It rained [ab, 3] + [ac, 4] = << [ab, 3] + [ac, 4] = [ad, 7] >> [ad, 7] inches on Monday. So it rained [ad, 7] * [aa, 2] = << [ad, 7] * [aa, 2] = [ae, 14] >> [ae, 14] inches on Tuesday. That means the total rainfall was [ad, 7] + [ae, 14] + [ac, 4] = << [ad, 7] + [ae, 14] + [ac, 4] = [answer, 25] >> [answer, 25] inches. #### [answer, 25]

[Julieta,name] went to the store to buy a backpack and [aa, 3] ring-binders for her school supplies. She knew the backpack was $ [ab, 50], and each ring-binder cost was $ [ac, 20]. However, at the store, she found out that the price of a back had increased by $ [ad, 5], and the price of a ring-binder had reduced by $ [ae, 2]. Calculate the total amount of money [Julieta,name] spent at the store.
Symb answer:
Initially, a backpack cost was $ [ab, 50]; when it increased by $ [ad, 5], the price became $ [ab, 50] + [ad, 5] = $ << [ab, 50] + [ad, 5] = [af, 55] >> [af, 55]. The price of a ring-binder $ [ac, 20], when it reduced by $ [ae, 2], the price became $ [ac, 20] - [ae, 2] = $ << [ac, 20] - [ae, 2] = [ag, 18] >> [ag, 18]. If she wanted to buy [aa, 3] ring-binders, she spent $ [ag, 18] * [aa, 3] = $ << [ag, 18] * [aa, 3] = [ah, 54] >> [ah, 54]. In total, [Julieta,name] spent $ [af, 55] + [ah, 54] = $ << [af, 55] + [ah, 54] = [answer, 109] >> [answer, 109]. #### [answer, 109]

Symb answer:
He has given out [ad, 120] tickets because [ab, 15] x [ac, 8] = << [ab, 15] * [ac, 8] = [ad, 120] >> [ad, 120]. He has [ae, 16] days left to hand out tickets because [af, 31] - [ab, 15] = << [af, 31] - [ab, 15] = [ae, 16] >> [ae, 16]. He has to give out [ag, 80] more because [aa, 200] - [ad, 120] = << [aa, 200] - [ad, 120] = [ag, 80] >> [ag, 80]. He has to give out [answer, 5] a day because [ag, 80] / [ae, 16] = << [ag, 80] / [ae, 16] = [answer, 5] >> [answer, 5]. #### [answer, 5]

Symb question:
[Porter,name] earns $ [aa, 8] per day and works [ab, 5] times a week. His manager is asking him to work an extra day that promises him an extra [ac, 50] percent on top of his daily rate. How much money will he earn after a month if he renders overtime every week?
Symb answer:
[Porter,name]'s weekly earning is $ [aa, 8] x [ab, 5] = $ << [aa, 8] * [ab, 5] = [ad, 40] >> [ad, 40]. [Porter,name]'s monthly earning is $ [ad, 40] x [ae, 4] = $ << [ad, 40] * [ae, 4] = [af, 160] >> [af, 160]. The extra amount he will earn when he works on his overtime is $ [aa, 8] x [ac, 50] / [ag, 100] = $ << [aa, 8] * [ac, 50] / [ag, 100] = [ae, 4] >> [ae, 4]. So the amount he will earn on his overtime is $ [aa, 8] + $ [ae, 4] = $ << [aa, 8] + [ae, 4] = [ah, 12] >> [ah, 12]. Since he will render overtime once every week, the total overtime pay he will earn in a month is $ [ah, 12] x [ae, 4] = $ << [ah, 12] * [ae, 4] = [ai, 48] >> [ai, 48]. Therefore the total money he will earn in a week is $ [af, 160] + [ai, 48] = $ << [af, 160] + [ai, 48] = [answer, 208] >> [answer, 208]. #### [answer, 208]
Conditions:
[aa, 8] * [ab, 5]=[ad, 40]
[ad, 40] * [ae, 4]=[af, 160]
[aa, 8] * [ac, 50] / [ag, 100]=[ae, 4]
[aa, 8] + [ae, 4]=[ah, 12]
[ah, 12] * [ae, 4]=[ai, 48]
[af, 160] + [ai, 48]=[answer, 208]

Symb answer:
[Olaf,name] is [aa, 12] years + [ab, 3] years = << [aa, 12] + [ab, 3] = [af, 15] >> [af, 15] years old. [Shannen,name] is [af, 15] years old - [ac, 2] years = << [af, 15] - [ac, 2] = [ag, 13] >> [ag, 13] years old. [Jack,name] is [ad, 5] years + ([ac, 2] * [ag, 13] years) = << [ad, 5] + ( [ac, 2] * [ag, 13] ) = [ah, 31] >> [ah, 31] years old. The sum of all of their ages is [aa, 12] + [af, 15] + [ag, 13] + [ah, 31] = << [aa, 12] + [af, 15] + [ag, 13] + [ah, 31] = [answer, 71] >> [answer, 71] years old. #### [answer, 71]

Symb answer:
First divide [ad, 32] by [ab, 3], ignoring the remainder, to find how many chapters in the book are divisible by [ab, 3]: [aa, 31] / [ab, 3] = [ae, 10.33]..., which means [af, 10] chapters are divisible by [ab, 3]. Then subtract that number from the total number of chapters to find how many chapters she reads: [aa, 31] chapters - [af, 10] chapters = << [aa, 31] - [af, 10] = [ag, 21] >> [ag, 21] chapters. Then multiply the number of chapters by the time to read each chapter to find the total time she spends reading: [ag, 21] chapters * [ac, 20] minutes/chapter = << [ag, 21] * [ac, 20] = [ah, 420] >> [ah, 420] minutes.

There are [aa,100] students in class and the ratio of boys to girls is [ab,3] : [ac,2]. How many more boys than girls are there?
Symb answer:
The class was divided into [ab,3] + [ac,2] = << [ab,3] + [ac,2] = [ad,5] >> [ad,5] parts. So each part is equal to [aa,100] / [ad,5] = << [aa,100] / [ad,5] = [answer,20] >> [answer,20] students. Since there are [ab,3] parts for boys, then there are [answer,20] x [ab,3] = << [ab,3] * [answer,20] = [ae,60] >> [ae,60] boys in class. So there are [aa,100] - [ae,60] = << [aa,100] - [ae,60] = [af,40] >> [af,40] girls in class.
