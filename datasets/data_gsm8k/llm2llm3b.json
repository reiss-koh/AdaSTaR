Later in the day, she decides to add 25 more titles to her collection. At night, she buys 5 additional e-books. If each e-book occupies 8 MB of memory space, how much memory space in MB will the new e-books occupy?",
        "answer": "The total number of e-books downloaded is 20 e-books + 25 e-books + 5 e-books = 50 e-books. The total size of the e-books is 50 e-books x 8 MB/e-book = 400 MB.\n#### 400"

        "question": "A swimming pool can be emptied by a drain in 5 hours and filled by a hose in 8 hours. The pool holds 200 liters of water. If the pool starts filled with water, how much water will be left after 4 hours?",
        "answer": "The drain empties the pool at a rate of 200 liters / 5 hours = 40 liters/hour. After 4 hours, the drain will have removed 4 * 40 = 160 liters of water. The hose fills the pool at a rate of 200 liters / 8 hours = 25 liters/hour. After 4 hours, the hose will have added 4 * 25 = 100 liters of water. Therefore, after 4 hours, there will be 200 liters - 160 liters + 100 liters = 140 liters of water left in the pool.\n#### 140"

        "answer": "5000 bees hatch daily. In 5 days, 5000 * 5 = 25000 new bees. The queen loses 700 bees daily, so in 5 days, there will be 700 * 5 = 3500 fewer bees. Initially, the queen had 20000 bees. Therefore, at the end of 5 days, the hive will have 20000 + 25000 - 3500 = 41500 bees. Including the queen, the total number of bees in the hive is 41500 + 1 = 41501.\n#### 41501"

        "answer": "After spending $25, Daniel is left with $60. The $60 is 100% - 30% = 70% of the remainder of his money after spending on clothes. Since 70% is $60, then 1% is $60/70 = $0.857. Thus, Daniel had $0.857 x 100 = $85.70 left after he spent money on clothes. The $85.70 is 100% - 45% = 55% of his original money. So 1% is $85.70/55 = $1.56.

        "answer": "Let x be the number of players who need a size 8 and y be the number who need a size 12. We know that x = 2y and x + y + 6 = 23. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2y + y + 6 = 23. Combining like terms, we get 3y + 6 = 23. Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get 3y = 17. Dividing both sides by 3, we get y = 17 / 3 = 5.67. Since y must be a whole number, we find the next closest whole number to 5.67, which is 6. Substituting that value back into the equation x = 2y, we get x = 2 * 6 = 12.\n#### 12"

        "answer": "If 4,000 square feet represents one-fifth of the third floor storage space, then the third floor has 4,000*5 = 20,000 square feet of storage space. Since the second floor has three times as much space as the third floor, it has 20,000*3 = 60,000 square feet. Therefore, the entire building has 20,000 + 60,000 = 80,000 square feet of storage space. As 4,000 square feet is filled with filing cabinets, there are 80,000 - 4,000 = 76,000 square feet of unused storage space remaining in the building.\n#### 76,000"

How many birds did Sarah see during her bird watching expedition?",
        "answer": "Sarah initially spots 25 blue jays. There are 25 blue jays * 3 cardinals/blue jay = 75 cardinals. The robins seen are twice the number of cardinals, so there are 75 cardinals * 2 robins/cardinal = 150 robins. Adding these together, she sees 25 + 75 + 150 = 250 birds on the first day. On the second day, observing sparrows and their mates, there are 15 sparrows * 2 birds/sparrow = 30 birds in total. On the third day, halving the number of blue jays results in 25 blue jays / 2 = 12 blue jays. With the same number of cardinals as day one, there are 12 blue jays + 75 cardinals = 87 birds.

Bob filled one-third of the third floor storage space with office supplies, using up 6,000 square feet. How many square feet of storage space are still available in the building?",
        "answer": "If 6,000 square feet represents one-third of the third floor storage space, then the third floor has 6,000 * 3 = 18,000 square feet of storage space. Since the second floor has three times the space, it has 18,000 * 3 = 54,000 square feet. The total space in the building is 18,000 (third floor) + 54,000 (second floor) + 6,000 (used) = 78,000 square feet.

        "question": "Sarah normally earns $15 per hour. Due to high demand, she worked overtime last week. Her paycheck (before taxes) was $945. For every hour after 40 hours in a week, Sarah earns 1.5 times her normal wage. How many hours did Sarah work last week?",
        "answer": "Sarah earned $945 in total. At her normal wage, she earned $15/hour * 40 hours = $600. This means she earned $945 - $600 = $345 at her overtime wage. Her overtime wage is $15 * 1.5 = $22.50 per hour. Thus, Sarah worked $345 / $22.50 per hour = 15 hours worth of overtime. Therefore, Sarah worked 40 hours + 15 hours = 55 hours last week.\n#### 55"

        "answer": "The total number of pages in the series is 10 books * 150 pages/book = 1500 pages. Mia read 4 books * 150 pages/book = 600 pages in the first month, leaving 10 - 4 = 6 books. In the second month, she reads 1/3 * 6 books = 2 books. Total pages read: 600 pages + 2 books * 150 pages/book = 900 pages.

        "answer": "With the buy-1-get-1-free deal, it costs $6 to buy 2 deluxe pizzas, which means each deluxe pizza costs $6/2 = $3. Using the buy-2-get-1-free deal, it costs $12 to buy 3 veggie pizzas, making the cost per veggie pizza $12/3 = $4. Bella's Bistro charges $3 per deluxe pizza and $4 per veggie pizza. Therefore, 12 deluxe pizzas cost 12 * $3 = $36, and 10 veggie pizzas cost 10 * $4 = $40. The total cost is $36 + $40 = $76.\n#### 76"

She wants to fill her round pool with a diameter of 8 feet. If each gallon of water fills 1.5 cubic feet of the pool, how many baths can Sarah take in August?",
        "answer": "First, calculate the volume of the pool: (1/4) * \u03c0 * (8 feet)^2 * 1.5 feet = 48\u03c0 cubic feet. This is also the number of gallons needed to fill the pool. Subtract the pool water and the drinking and cooking water: 800 gallons - 48\u03c0 gallons - 80 gallons = 720 - 48\u03c0 gallons. Divide the remaining water by the amount per bath: (720 - 48\u03c0) gallons / 15 gallons/bath = 48 - 3\u03c0 baths.\n#### 48 - 3\u03c0"

Since they have 35 fewer books than Cindy, they have 50 - 35 = 15 books. So, 4x = 15, which implies x = 15/4. Therefore, Aaron has 3 * 15/4 = 11.25 books, which we can round off to 11.\n#### 11"

Thus, 90 Asian swallows can carry 90 * 24 = 2160 pounds. 30 African swallows can carry 30 * 8 = 240 pounds. Therefore, a flock of 120 swallows can carry 2160 + 240 = 2400 pounds.\n#### 2400"

        "answer": "Let c be the number of students making cupcakes and b be the number making brownies. We know that b = 0.5c and c + b + x = 25, where x is the number of students baking cookies. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 0.5c + c + x = 25. Combining like terms, we get 1.5c + x = 25. Given c = 8, we have 1.5(8) + x = 25. Solving for x, we get x = 25 - 12 = 13. Since b = 0.5c, b = 0.5(8) = 4.\n#### 4"

        "question": "Ben spent 40% of his money on video games, and 15% of the remainder on movie tickets. After spending $25 on books, he is left with $70. How much money did Ben have initially?",
        "answer": "Ben had $25 + $70 = $95 left after paying for movie tickets. The $95 is 100% - 15% = 85% of the remainder of his money after spending on video games. Since 85% is $95, then 1% is $95/85 = $1.12. Thus, Ben had $1.12 x 100 = $112 left after he spent money on video games. The $112 is 100% - 40% = 60% of his original money. So 1% is $112/60 = $1.87.

        "question": "Sarah's property tax rate is 1.5%. Her house is currently worth $300,000. A new park nearby is expected to increase her house's value by 20%. Sarah can only afford to spend $12,000/year on property tax. How much money can she invest in improvements to her house before her property tax bill exceeds her budget?",
        "answer": "First calculate the increase in house value due to the park by multiplying the initial value by 20%: $300,000 * 0.20 = $60,000. Add this to the initial value to get the new value: $60,000 + $300,000 = $360,000. Calculate the maximum house value allowed based on property tax limit: $12,000 / 0.015 = $800,000. Subtract the new value from the maximum allowed value to find the maximum improvement investment: $800,000 - $360,000 = $440,000.\n#### 440000"

        "answer": "Let x be the number of students who need a level 5 workbook and y be the number who need a level 7 workbook. We know that x = 4y and x + y + 6 = 23. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 4y + y + 6 = 23. Combining like terms, we get 5y + 6 = 23. Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get 5y = 17. Dividing by 5, we get y = 17 / 5 = 3.4. Since we can't have 0.4 of a student, we round down to the nearest whole number. So, y = 3. Substituting back, x = 4 * 3 = 12.\n#### 12"

Subtract that number from the total number of tiles to find the number of white tiles: 288 tiles - 86 tiles = 202 tiles. Calculate the cost of the gray tiles: 86 tiles * $2.50/tile = $215. Calculate the cost of the white tiles: 202 tiles * $1.75/tile = $353.50. Finally, add the costs of both types of tiles to find the total cost: $215 + $353.50 = $568.50.\n#### 568.5"

How much will Sarah spend on her laptop in the first year?",
        "answer": "First, find the cost of the laptop bag: $1500 * 15% = $<<1500*15*.01=225>>225. Then find the cost of the wireless mouse: $225 / 3 = $<<225/3=75>>75. Next, calculate the cost of the software subscription per year: $30/month * 12 months/year = $<<30*12=360>>360.

Solving, x = 24 African swallows and 3x = 72 European swallows. Each European swallow carries 7 pounds, so 72 European swallows can carry 72 * 7 = 504 pounds. Since each African swallow can carry 3 times that weight, 24 African swallows can carry 504 * 3 = 1512 pounds. Therefore, the flock of 120 swallows can carry 504 + 1512 = 2016 pounds.\n#### 2016"

If there was a group of 120 swallows, with twice as many Asians as Africans, what is the maximum combined weight the group can carry?",
        "answer": "Let \"x\" be the number of African swallows. Since there are twice as many Asian swallows, there are 2x Asian swallows. Thus, the total number of swallows is 2x + x = 120. Solving for x, we get x = 40. The number of Asian swallows is 2 * 40 = 80. An Asian swallow can carry 6 * 3 = 18 pounds. So, 80 Asian swallows can carry 80 * 18 = 1440 pounds. 40 African swallows can carry 40 * 6 = 240 pounds. Therefore, the group of 120 swallows can carry 1440 + 240 = 1680 pounds.\n#### 1680"

        "answer": "After spending on books, Brandon is left with $120. The $120 is 100% - 30% = 70% of the remaining money after spending on shoes. Since 70% is $120, then 1% is $120/70 = $1.71. Thus, Brandon had $1.71 x 100 = $171 left after he spent on shoes. The $171 is 100% - 45% = 55% of his original money. So, 1% is $171/55 = $3.109.

Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2l + l + 6 = 22. Combining like terms, we get 3l + 6 = 22. Subtracting 6 from both sides, we get 3l = 16. Dividing both sides by 3, we get l = 16 / 3 = 5.33. Since we can't have a fraction of a player, we round down to the nearest whole number. Substituting that value back into the equation m = 2l, we get m = 2 * 5 = 10.\n#### 10"

        "answer": "Let t be the number of trees Tom planted and s be the number Sarah planted. We know t + s = 200 and s = 4t - 8. Substituting the second equation into the first, we get t + 4t - 8 = 200. Simplifying, we have 5t - 8 = 200. Adding 8 to both sides, we get 5t = 208.

How many square feet of storage space are still available in the building?",
        "answer": "Since 6,000 square feet represents one-fifth of the third floor storage space, the third floor has 6,000 * 5 = 30,000 square feet. As the first floor has three times the space of the third floor, it has 30,000 * 3 = 90,000 square feet. The total storage space in the building is 30,000 + 90,000 = 120,000 square feet.

She will pay $150 as a down payment and pay $50 for the first 3 months; then $45 for the next 3 months; then $40 for the last 4 months. How much will Sarah save if she buys the laptop in cash instead of on installment?",

        "answer": "On the first dive, Dory sees 20 clownfish * 3 = 60 angelfish. Thus, on the first dive, there are 20 clownfish + 60 angelfish = 80 fish. On the second dive, there are 6 seahorses * 2 siblings each = 18 seahorses. On the third dive, there are 20 clownfish / 2 = 10 clownfish. Adding this to the 60 angelfish results in 10 clownfish + 60 angelfish = 70 fish on the third dive. Therefore, Dory observed 80 + 18 + 70 = 168 fish across the three dives.\n#### 168"

        "answer": "Let K stand for the number of kWh billed, so the total bill is $0.30K + $50 flat rate charge = $65 total bill. Now we will solve for K. $0.30K + $50 - $50 = $65 - $50.

        "question": "Max purchased a new three-story apartment building. The second floor has half as much floor space for storage as the third floor. Initially, Max decided to store several hundred books in the empty building, filling up half of the third floor storage space. If the books occupied 3,000 square feet of storage space, how many square feet of storage space is still available in the building?",
        "answer": "If 3,000 square feet represents half of the third floor storage space, then the third floor has 3,000*2 = 6,000 square feet of storage space. Since the second floor has half as much space as the third floor, the second floor has 6,000/2 = 3,000 square feet of storage space. The total storage space in the building is 6,000 + 3,000 + 6,000 = 15,000 square feet. Therefore, there are 15,000 - 3,000 = 12,000 square feet of unused storage space available in the building.\n#### 12,000"

        "answer": "Let s be the number of players who need a size 8 and t be the number who need a size 12. We know that s = 2t and s + t + 3 = 15. Substituting the first equation into the second equation, we get 2t + t + 3 = 15. Combining like terms, we get 3t + 3 = 15. Subtracting 3 from both sides, we get 3t = 12. Dividing both sides by 3, we get t = 4. Substituting that value back into the equation s = 2t, we get s = 2 * 4 = 8.\n#### 8"

        "answer": "Let J be the number of cupcakes Jake baked and M be the number Mia baked. We have J + M = 200 and M = 2J - 3. Substituting the second equation into the first, we get J + 2J - 3 = 200. Simplifying, we get 3J - 3 = 200. Adding 3 to both sides gives 3J = 203. Dividing both sides by 3, we find J = 67.\n#### 67"

        "answer": "Clara had $25 + $75 = $100 left after spending on groceries. The $100 is 100% - 30% = 70% of the remainder of her money after buying books. Since 70% is $100, then 1% is $100/70 = $1.43. Therefore, Clara had $1.43 x 100 = $143 left after buying books. The $143 is 100% - 45% = 55% of her original money. So 1% is $143/55 = $2.60.

At the start, the queen had 15000 bees. At the end of 5 days, she will have 15000 + 25000 - 6000 = 34000 bees. The total number of bees in the hive including the queen is 34000 + 1 = 34001.\n#### 34001"

        "question": "A basketball team shares a single sports drink bottle during practice. Guards get the first drink and consume 10 ounces each, while forwards get the second drink and drink 5 ounces each. The team consists of 8 guards and 6 forwards. If the sports drink bottle holds 100 ounces of liquid, how many forwards must wait for the bottle to be refilled before they can get a drink?",
        "answer": "The 8 guards will drink a total of 8 * 10 = 80 ounces of the drink first. This leaves 100 - 80 = 20 ounces for the forwards. With 20 ounces remaining, only 20 / 5 = 4 forwards can have a drink. Hence, 6 - 4 = 2 forwards must wait for the bottle to be refilled before they can get a drink.\n#### 2"

        "answer": "Since Ella swims half the length of the pool, she swims 30 / 2 = 15 meters. Sarah takes 25 minutes to swim 30 meters. The time it takes Ella to swim 15 meters is half of Sarah's time: 25 minutes / 2 = 12.5 minutes. Therefore, Ella swims at a speed of 15 meters / 12.5 minutes = 1.2 meters per minute.\n#### 1.2"

        "answer": "Sara collects 1200 + 1800 = 3000 milliliters of water from the well and borehole every day. Since 1 liter is equal to 1000 milliliters, then 70 liters is equal to 70 x 1000 = 70,000 milliliters of water.

The first season had 10 episodes, with each following season having 40% more episodes than the previous one. If there are 4 seasons in total, with the last season having 20 episodes, how much did it cost to produce all the episodes?",
        "answer": "The first season cost $80,000 * 10 = $800,000. Seasons 2-4 had 10 * 0.4 = 4 more episodes per season than the first. So they each had 10 + 4 = 14 episodes. The total number of episodes in the last 3 seasons is 14 + 14 + 20 = 48 episodes. These episodes cost 3 * $80,000 = $240,000 each, making the total cost for the last 3 seasons $240,000 * 48 = $11,520,000.

        "question": "Due to water conservation efforts, Anne's household can only use 1200 liters of water during a month. Anne uses 100 liters for cooking and drinking and 15 liters per bath. She wants to fill her fish tank, which measures 5 feet by 2 feet by 3 feet. If each liter of water fills 1 cubic foot of the fish tank, how many baths can Anne take in the month?",
        "answer": "First, calculate the total volume of the fish tank: 5 feet * 2 feet * 3 feet = 30 cubic feet. This is also the number of liters needed to fill the tank. Subtract the tank water and the cooking and drinking water from the total amount of water Anne can use: 1200 liters - 30 liters - 100 liters = 1070 liters. Then, divide the remaining water for baths by the amount of water per bath to find how many baths Anne can take: 1070 liters / 15 liters per bath = 71.33 baths\n#### 71"

        "answer": "There are 60/100 * 5 = <<60/100*5=3>>3 more pink roses than white roses. So in Lily's garden, there are 5 + 3 = 8 pink roses. White and pink roses sum up to 5 + 8 = <<5+8=13>>13 roses. That means in Lily's garden there are 30/100 * 13 = <<30/100*13=4>>4 red roses.

        "answer": "Since, two years from now Claire will have 10 books, this year she has 10 - 2 = 8 books in her collection. Since she had 3 books at the age of 12, she has added 8 - 3 = 5 books since she was 12. Since she adds one book per year, 5 added books = 5 added years.

        "answer": "First, find the area of the kitchen floor: 8 feet * 12 feet = 96 square feet. Then, multiply the area by the number of tiles per square foot to get the total number of tiles needed: 96 square feet * 3 tiles/square foot = 288 tiles. Next, multiply the total number of tiles by the percentage that are blue to find the number of blue tiles: 288 tiles * 60% = 172.8, which we round up to 173 tiles.

        "question": "In eight years, I'll be three times my sister's age. The sum of our ages at that time will be 52 years old. How old am I now?",
        "answer": "Let X be my age now. In eight years, I'll be X + 8 years old. In eight years, my sister will be (X + 8) / 3 years old. The sum of our ages in eight years will be (X + 8) + (X + 8) / 3 = 52. Simplifying, we get (4X + 32) / 3 = 52. Solving for X, we have 4X + 32 = 52 * 3, X = (52 * 3 - 32) / 4 = 36 / 4 = 9.\n#### 9"
